## Planned list

1. Complete chrome-fs driver for use as a chrome app / chromebook app
2. Add core emulated context menus, that will be hooked by modules
3. Add a "buffer overview" module that shows all open buffers
4. Better handling when a buffer that is already open is opened to prevent double up writing bugs.
